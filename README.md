Uses
Node | Android | MongoDB

This app connects hospitals all around the world with the people who are in need of medical help urgently.
By providing an easy to use mobile application,anhbody who wants to rescue people out of emergencies and accidents can use it to find the
nearest hospital and seek their help to bring an ambulance to the spot where an accident or any other medical emergency occurs.The app also 
asks additional information from the user to keep the doctor's team ready to treat the affected people,when they reach the hospital.This project
is started by me and is completely open sourced.Any improvements and suggestion are welcome.
